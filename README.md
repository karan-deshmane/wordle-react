# Wordle Pro

A feature-rich, difficulty-adjustable clone of the popular word guessing game **Wordle**, built with React

## Features

- **Three difficulty levels**  
  - **Easy**: 4-letter words, 6 guesses  
  - **Medium**: 5-letter words, 6 guesses  
  - **Hard**: 6-letter words, 5 guesses  
- **Animated tiles** using [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) for flips, shakes, and feedback.  
- **Custom word lists** for each difficulty level.  
- **Real-time input validation** (invalid guesses shake the row).  
- **Randomized secret word** each game.  


## Getting Started

```

```
npm install
